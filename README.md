# Project Cervello

## üß† What it Does
The brain is the physical basis for "you". It's activities not only keep our body up and functioning, it also serves as the center for processing the experiences, thoughts, & emotions that create our sense of identity & awareness. Project Cervello interprets input from an electroencephalogram (EEG) device to provide patients with a comprehensive summary of their brain's health: including alerts of irregularities in brain activity, a rating of their cognitive performance, mental health indicators & neuroplasticity insights. Based off the patients' results, Cervello will suggest possible lifestyle changes, excercises, & contacts to local medical specialists & services that could improve or maintain patient brain health.

## üíª Potential Features
- Real-Time Brainwave Monitoring: Continuously track & visualize EEG signals.
- Personalized Health Recommendations: Offer tailored exercise or relaxation tips based on analyzed data.
- Alerts for Stress & Anxiety: Detect stress-related anomalies, prompting timely interventions.
- Performance Tracking: Display historical trends to highlight progress or recurring issues.
- Web Application: Provide an accessible interface for data, goals, & recommendations.
